Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

- In general the more opportunities you give program to learn, the better it performs
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Recommender Systems
- Reinforcement Learning

## Supervised Learning

Supervised machine learning or more commonly, supervised learning, refers to algorithms that learn x to y or input to output mappings. (*learn from data labeled with right answers*)

The key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give 
your learning algorithm examples to learn from. That includes the right answers, whereby right answer, the correct label y for a given input x, and is by seeing correct pairs of input x and desired output label y that the learning algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label and gives a reasonably accurate prediction or guess of the output

### Applications:

- spam filtering
- speech recognition
- machine translation
- online advertising
- self-driving cars
- Visual Inspection

### Regression:
predicting a number from infinitely many possible numbers by fitting of straight line/curve for prediction of the output based on input.

### Classification:
It is different from regression is that we're trying to predict only a small number of possible outputs or categories. 

*Breast Cancer Detection*
In this case two possible outputs 0 or 1, benign or malignant. 
This is different from regression which tries to predict any number, 
all of the infinitely many number of possible numbers. And so the fact that there are only two possible outputs is what makes this classification. Predict categories/classes.

Boundaries that separate the classes is known as Hyperplane.

## Unsupervised Learning:
Find something interesting(structures, patterns etc) in unlabeled data
Data only comes with inputs x, but not output labels y. Algorithm has to find structure in the data.

Examples:
- Clustering: Groups data points into clusters
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Anomaly Detection
